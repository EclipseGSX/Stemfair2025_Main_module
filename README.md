# Howdy there!
This is the code for how the hand detection module shall work. You can find it at the top of the tab which says "cv two.py".

&nsp;

Some $${\color{red}Side}$$ $${\color{red}Notes}$$ though:

&nsp;
For the code to function it needs to be able to refer of our previous code module ("the assistance module") meaning that the name should be $${\color{red}SPECIFICLY}$$ 

<pre> Assistance_module </pre>

&nsp; 

if you do not like the name of the module, you can change it. Just copy the name and paste it Here↓↓↓ 



- Also ensure that they are both in the same folder, so they can access each other
