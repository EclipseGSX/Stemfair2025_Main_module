# Howdy there!

This is the code for how the hand detection module shall work. You can find it at the top of the tab which says "cv two.py".


Some $${\color{red}Side}$$ $${\color{red}Notes}$$ though:


For the code to function it needs to be able to refer of our previous code module ("the assistance module") meaning that the name should be $${\color{red}SPECIFICLY}$$ 

<pre> Assistance_module </pre>


If you do not Fancy the name of the module, you can change it. Just copy the name and paste it Here↓↓↓ 
- Also ensure that they are both in the same folder, so they can access each other

Alrighty now that we have completed the coding for the robot now we shall be constructing it.

$${\color{red}CONSTRUCTION:}$$

Materials needed:
- 2 Arduinos Unos
- 9 220 ohm resistors
- 4 $${\color{red}red}$$ wire
- 4 $${\color{yellow}yellow}$$ wires
- 4 $${\color{orange}orange}$$ wires
- 4 $${\color{blue}blue}$$ wires
- 2 white wires
- 2 $${\color{green}green}$$ wires
- 2 breadboards

- Follow the diagram shown:

This is for the first arduino which controls the up and down motion. (ARDUINO 1 GUYS) FIX IT IN YOUR CODE IF NEEDED BY CHANING THE COM PORT

This is for the fingers being middeled. (ARDUINO 2 GUYS) FIX IT IN YOUR CODE IF NEEDED BY CHANING THE COM PORT

Anyhow thanks for sticking with me for this whole project/construction and coding. I appreciate your time and I hope you have a nice day!!!

If you have any questions you can leave a comment (its not 100% that I may respond to all of them)
